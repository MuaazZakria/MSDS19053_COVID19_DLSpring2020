Assignment # 5
Detecting COVID-19 from X-Rays

Task-1: Fine-Tuning FC Layers
For both pre-trained networks, I used the following parameters:
Epochs = 10
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(vgg16.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

1.	VGG-16:
Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images came out to be 97 %.
The confusion matrices of training, testing and validation are given below:
Confusion matrix for training
tensor([[2315., 1999.],
    		   [3310., 2876.]])

Confusion matrix for testing
tensor([[276., 254.],
    		   [429., 357.]])

Confusion matrix for training
tensor([[286., 262.],
        [419., 349.]])

2.	ResNet-18:
Accuracy of the ResNet-18 network on the 10000 test images came out to be 41 % which was quite low as compared to VGG-16.
The confusion matrices of training, testing and validation are given below:
Confusion matrix for training
tensor([[4289.,    0.],
[6211.,    0.]])

Confusion matrix for testing
tensor([[548.,   0.],
        		[768.,   0.]])

Confusion matrix for training
tensor([[536.,   0.],
        	[780.,   0.]])

1.	VGG-16:
Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images came out to be 97 %.
The confusion matrices of training, testing and validation are given below:

        		[2406., 3799.]])

Confusion matrix for testing
tensor([[208., 331.],
        		[309., 468.]])

Confusion matrix for training
tensor([[199., 340.],
        	[318., 459.]])

2.	ResNet-18:
Accuracy of the ResNet-18 network on the 10000 test images came out to be 41 % which was quite low as compared to VGG-16.
